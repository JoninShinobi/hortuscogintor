## 1. Company Description

### 1.1 Company Overview
**Name**: Hortus Cognitor  
**Tagline**: "Growing a Regenerative Movement"  
**Founded**: 2024  
**Location**: Leicester, UK (operating at Graceworks Permaculture Project in Evington and The Laurel CSA project)

Hortus Cognitor is an educational organization that delivers transformational learning experiences through hands-on engagement with agriculture and land-based practices. The company operates from a philosophy that meaningful change comes through direct, embodied connection with the natural world rather than theoretical approaches alone.

### 1.2 Mission Statement
To bridge the gap between feeling powerless and becoming powerful agents of change through deep, embodied connection with the natural world. We create spaces where transformation isn't just a concept—it's a lived, growing reality.

### 1.3 Company Philosophy
The organization is founded on the principle that "the land is constantly invoking change, creating new paradigms and realities." Hortus Cognitor rejects what it sees as empty statements about creating change, instead focusing on practical, hands-on learning that produces tangible results. The approach emphasizes listening to "what the soil and plants can show us about growing colourful, meaningful and powerful change."

### 1.4 Core Values
- **Experiential Learning**: Learning through direct experience with soil, plants, and sustainable growing practices that create real, tangible results
- **Community Connection**: Building relationships and shared understanding through collaborative work with the land and each other
- **Personal Transformation**: Discovering how working with nature creates profound shifts in perspective, purpose, and personal power
- **Authenticity**: Moving beyond empty statements into dynamic and powerful ethos by which we live

### 1.5 Founder & Leadership
The organization is led by Hannah Watkins, who brings a unique combination of academic credentials and practical farming expertise. Hannah holds a 1st class BA (Hons) in Social Policy and Criminology from The Open University and a distinction-level MSc in Psychology from Birmingham City University. She previously served as Equalities Manager for Leicester City Council and started a mental health unit for people with severe brain injuries. 

Hannah transitioned from this background to become a dedicated vegetable farmer, gaining extensive growing experience through multiple agricultural roles: Seasonal Grower at Teign Greens (8 months), Grower at Community Harvest Whetstone (3 months), Grower at Shillingford Organics (1 year), and currently Head Grower at Community Harvest Whetstone (since December 2023). She has also completed formal training including a Permaculture Design Certificate in Regenerative Land Based Systems and Agroecology from The Apricot Centre and an Introduction to Permaculture certificate from Graceworks Evington. Operating over 2 acres at Community Harvest Whetstone, Hannah demonstrates the transformational journey that Hortus Cognitor seeks to facilitate for others.
