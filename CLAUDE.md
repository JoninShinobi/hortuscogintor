4. Run `source venv/bin/activate` in `/Users/aarondudfield/Desktop/Projects/Hortus Cognitor`

# Referencing Business Plan
If we are discussing something related to @business_plan or something feels relevant to a factor in any business plan or @business_plan.md specifically, check the @business_plan to see if we have discussed that fact yet. If not, add it to the relevant section. We will slowly develop the business plan as we work through. Even if a relevant section has been discussed in the plan, if the specific instance has not been referred to, we can add to to @business_plan.md
